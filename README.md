# Password-Generator
In this project I was tasked with creating a random password generator using javascript. When used it will generate a random password for any user/employee/company to ensure the password would not be easily guessed adding a layer of security to the accounts th eapsswors would be used for.

This Challenge was exactly that, a challenge, javascript is something I'm still wrapping my head around and I had to utilize many of the resources available to me to be able to get the syntaxes and the math codes I needed to make this generator. Although I had struggles I still kept at it, and I now have a working site that is able to generate paswords using capital letters, lowercase letter, special characters, and numbers.

In the future I hope to to gain a mastery of javascript as I was pretty intimidated starting this project, and now that I have a finished project I feel that I have a better understanding of javascript and have a good foundation to build on as i continue my training as a web developer.
